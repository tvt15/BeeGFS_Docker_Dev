# BeeGFS Parallel File System
BeeGFS (formerly FhGFS) is the leading parallel cluster file system,
developed with a strong focus on performance and designed for very easy
installation and management.
If I/O intensive workloads are your problem, BeeGFS is the solution.

# Build Instructions

## Prerequisites
Before building BeeGFS, install the following dependency packages:

### Red Hat / CentOS
```
$ yum install libuuid-devel libibverbs-devel librdmacm-devel libattr-devel redhat-rpm-config \
  rpm-build xfsprogs-devel zlib-devel gcc-c++ gcc \
  redhat-lsb-core java-devel unzip libcurl-devel elfutils-libelf-devel kernel-devel \
  libblkid-devel libnl3-devel
```

The `elfutils-libelf-devel` and `kernel-devel` packages can be omitted if you don't intend to
build the client module.

On RHEL releases older than 8, the additional `devtoolset-7` package is also required,
which provides a newer compiler version. The installation steps are outlined here.
Please consult the documentation of your distribution for details.

  1. Install a package with repository for your system:
   - On CentOS, install package centos-release-scl available in CentOS repository:
     ```
     $ sudo yum install centos-release-scl
     ```
   - On RHEL, enable RHSCL repository for you system:
     ```
     $ sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
     ```
  2. Install the collection:
     ```
     $ sudo yum install devtoolset-7
     ```

  3. Start using software collections:
     ```
     $ scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
     ```
  4. Follow the instructions below to build BeeGFS.

### Debian and Ubuntu

#### Option 1: Semi-automatic installation of build dependencies

Install required utilities:
```
$ apt install --no-install-recommends devscripts equivs
```
Automatically install build dependencies:
```
$ mk-build-deps --install debian/control
```

#### Option 2: Manual installation of build dependencies

Run this command to install the required packages:
```
$ sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake pkg-config devscripts debhelper \
  libtool libattr1-dev xfslibs-dev lsb-release kmod librdmacm-dev libibverbs-dev \
  default-jdk zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libblkid-dev uuid-dev \
  libnl-3-200 libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-200 libnl-route-3-200 libnl-route-3-dev dh-dkms
```
Note: If you have an older Debian system you might have to install the `module-init-tools`
package instead of `kmod`.  You also have the choice between the openssl, nss, or gnutls version
of `libcurl-dev`. Choose the one you prefer. On Debian versions older than 12, replace `dh-dkms`
by `dkms`.

## Building Packages

### For development systems

BeeGFS comes with a Makefile capable of building packages for the system on which it is executed.
These include all services, the client module and utilities.

To build RPM packages, run
```
 $ make package-rpm PACKAGE_DIR=packages
```
You may also enable parallel execution with
```
 $ make package-rpm PACKAGE_DIR=packages RPMBUILD_OPTS="-D 'MAKE_CONCURRENCY <n>'"
```
where `<n>` is the number of concurrent processes.

For DEB packages use this command:
```
 $ make package-deb PACKAGE_DIR=packages
```
Or start with `<n>` jobs running in parallel:
```
 $ make package-deb PACKAGE_DIR=packages DEBUILD_OPTS="-j<n>"
```

This will generate individual packages for each service (management, meta-data, storage)
as well as the client kernel module and administration tools.

The above examples use `packages` as the output folder for packages, which must not exist
and will be created during the build process.
You may specify any other non-existent directory instead.

Note, however, that having `PACKAGE_DIR` on a NFS or similar network share may slow down
the build process significantly.

### For production systems, or from source snapshots

By default the packaging system generates version numbers suitable only for development
packages. Packages intended for installation on production systems must be built differently.
All instructions to build development packages (as given above) apply, but additionally the
package version must be explicitly set. This is done by passing `BEEGFS_VERSION=<version>`
in the make command line, e.g.
```
 $ make package-deb PACKAGE_DIR=packages DEBUILD_OPTS="-j<n>" BEEGFS_VERSION=7.1.4-local1
```

Setting the version explicitly is required to generate packages that can be easily upgraded
with the system package manager.


## Building without packaging
To build the complete project without generating any packages,
simply run
```
$ make
```

The sub-projects have individual make targets, for example `storage-all`,
`meta-all`, etc.

To speed things you can use the `-j` option of `make`.
Additionally, the build system supports `distcc`:
```
$ make DISTCC=distcc
```

# BeeGFS Docker Development Environment

This repository contains a Docker-based development environment for BeeGFS (Bee GNU/Linux File System), a parallel file system for high-performance computing.

## Overview

The Docker environment provides a containerized setup to build, test, and run BeeGFS components without affecting your host system. It includes all necessary dependencies and tools required for BeeGFS development.

## Features

- Complete development environment with all required dependencies
- Isolated testing environment for BeeGFS components
- Pre-configured service directories and configuration files
- SSH access for remote development
- Support for running various BeeGFS services (Management, Metadata, Storage, Helper)

## Usage

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t beegfs-dev .
```

### Running the Container

```bash
docker run -it --name beegfs-dev-container \
  -v /path/to/beegfs/source:/beegfs \
  -p 22:22 -p 8008:8008 -p 8003:8003 -p 8004:8004 \
  beegfs-dev
```

### Environment Variables

- `BUILD_ON_START`: Set to "true" to automatically build BeeGFS on container start
- `START_SERVICE`: Specify which service to start (mgmtd, meta, storage, helperd, client, or all)

### Directory Structure

The container sets up the following directory structure for BeeGFS services:

- `/data/mgmt_tgt_mgmt01`: Management service storage
- `/data/meta_01_tgt_0101`: Metadata service storage
- `/data/stor_01_tgt_101`, `/data/stor_01_tgt_102`: Storage service storage

## Development

This Docker setup is intended for development purposes. For production deployments, please refer to the official BeeGFS documentation.

## License

This Docker environment is provided under the same license as BeeGFS.
