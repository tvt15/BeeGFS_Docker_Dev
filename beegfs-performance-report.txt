# BeeGFS Performance and Storage Report

## 1. BeeGFS Setup Summary
- Management service: Running on port 8008
- Metadata service: Running on port 8003
- Storage service: Running on port 8005
- Client successfully mounted at /mnt/beegfs

## 2. File Operations Performance

### Sequential I/O Performance
- Sequential Write: 2349 MiB/s (2463 MB/s) at 2348 IOPS
- Sequential Read: 1309 MiB/s (1373 MB/s) at 1309 IOPS

### Random I/O Performance
- Random Write: 596 MiB/s (625 MB/s) at 153k IOPS
- Random Read: 231 MiB/s (242 MB/s) at 59.1k IOPS
- Mixed Read/Write: Read 191 MiB/s (200 MB/s) at 48.8k IOPS, Write 63.9 MiB/s (67.0 MB/s) at 16.4k IOPS

## 3. System Resource Utilization

### CPU Utilization
- Average CPU usage while active: ~17% user, ~2.5% system
- Peak CPU usage observed on cores 0 and 7

### Memory Utilization
- Total Memory: 64123 MB
- Used Memory: 29871 MB
- Available Memory: 32120 MB

## 4. Storage Structure

### Files Created in BeeGFS Mount
- Large test files (500+ MB): Multiple for I/O performance tests
- Medium files (~100 MB): Created for testing
- Small files (~5-10 MB): Created for testing
- Multiple test directories with nested structure

### Storage Architecture
- File data distributed across storage targets (though not visible with our tools)
- Metadata stored in separate directory structure

## 5. Conclusion
The BeeGFS filesystem is functioning correctly with excellent performance characteristics, particularly for write operations. The high IOPS rate for random operations suggests the setup is optimized for high-performance computing workloads.
