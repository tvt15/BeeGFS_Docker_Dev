BeeGFS Server and Client Configuration Summary:
=================================================

1. Server (beegfs-dev):
   - Management service: Port 8008 (TCP/UDP)
   - Metadata service: Port 8003 (TCP/UDP)
   - Storage service: Port 8005 (TCP/UDP)

2. Client:
   - All services are reachable from client container
   - Client container is on same Docker network as server

3. Issues solved:
   - Network connectivity fixed by connecting containers to same Docker network
   - Identified correct storage service port (8005 not 8004)

4. Next steps:
   - For full client functionality, consider using official BeeGFS client packages
   - Alternatively, modify client Dockerfile to build kernel module with proper C/C++ support
